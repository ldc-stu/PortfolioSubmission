#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
The Airgead banking app is a calculator that computes an investment that is compounded annualy with the variables of your choice. It will take user inputs of intial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest and amount of years so it may display both year end balance and year end earned interest.

#What did you do particularly well?
In this program in particular, I feel as if the use of arithmetic and how values were calcualted were done right but fell into the trap of craving for more as I had over complicated the code when attempting an elaborate GUI.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
In order to enchance I should do less. I had focused more on making it pretty and completly ignoring a straight forward approach where the program should just do what it would need. Shifting focal points will render our code with proper functionality without the bells and whistles.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
A bump in the road while writing this code was displaying the 2nd menu of the 2 static reports (year end balance, year end earned interest). With the current knowledge of classes I was ignorant in the fact of how to properly use cin objects in order for better readability and inturn easier call backs. Stackoverflow and other github repositories were of huge assistance in most my projects.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Other than the obvious computation practice especially in a "banking" situation like this, the mistake of over complication led to a lesson of the effiency in simplicity and foundation building.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In order to improve readability labels are used to quickly differentiate each part and how said lines participate in the program. For example which part is a constrtuctor and which lines are used to compute or display.
